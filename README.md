# silver-octo-robot

Project with multiple public available, and others not, samples. All integrated in one app.

Here you will find examples of:
- Routing;
- Re-dash vs atom-based states;
- Camera usage to scan barcodes (qrcodes, etc.);

## Getting Started

To kick off the project:

``` sh
clj -M:cljd flutter
```

If you want to run a simulator, you have to do it, before running this command. To specify a device, add `-d <device-id>`

``` sh
flutter devices
```

Can show you which ones are available.
